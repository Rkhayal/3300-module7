        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            According to PEW Research, 96% of adults aged 18-29 occasionally check reviews before purchasing a product. But does this necessarily mean that higher ratings lead to greater sales? Specifically, when it comes to video games, do high ratings equate to increased sales volume? While it's possible that well-rated games sell more copies, some lesser-known titles with passionate fan bases might receive better ratings than widely popular games with massive sales figures. Additionally, I’m interested in examining whether video game production has surged in recent years and, if so, whether this increase has impacted the quality of games, as measured by their reviews. Could an oversaturated market lead to declining review scores over time?
            
            
        </p>
        <p>
            For this project, I intend to analyze user and critic review scores from Metacritic and correlate them with sales data from VGChartz. By merging these datasets, I aim to determine whether a relationship exists between review scores and overall game sales.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="data">
        <h2>2. Data</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
        <p>
            I gathered review data from Metacritic, which included both user (user score) and critic (meta score) ratings for various games. The data was compiled from 186 different web pages using a web scraping script. The dataset comprises details such as game titles, summaries, platforms, user scores, meta scores, and release dates for 18,526 games. Some games appeared multiple times due to releases on different platforms, an important factor to consider when merging datasets. This information is stored in Metacritic.csv, while the web scraping script is saved in metacritic.R. Minimal cleaning was required, though I did create a dictionary to align platform names from Metacritic with those from VGChartz. This cleaning process is documented in combining_vgs.R.
        </p>
        <h3>2.2 Additional Data</h3>
        <p>
            VGChartz offers sales figures for different game/platform combinations. The dataset spans 1,249 web pages, so I split the extracted data into six separate CSV files (VGChartz_0–5.csv). These files are housed in the project folder, along with the web scraping script, vgchartz.R. The dataset covers game titles, platforms, release dates, publishers, and regional sales figures from PAL, Japan, and North America, in addition to total global sales. Some titles appeared multiple times due to releases on different platforms, and some game series were listed alongside individual entries. To clean the dataset, I combined all six CSV files into a single dataset, removed unnecessary columns, standardized text formatting, and filtered out game series. Missing values were labeled as NA. The data cleaning for this dataset was also performed in combining_vgs.R.
        </p>
        <h3>2.3 Combining Reviews and Sales</h3>
        <p>
            Since both datasets contained duplicate game titles based on platform differences, I merged them by matching both game titles and platforms. Given the significant discrepancy in the number of observations in each dataset, I created two versions of the merged dataset: an intersection containing only games present in both datasets and a union including all available data. The merging process is detailed in combining_vgs.R, and further cleaning was conducted in cleaning_vgs.R. This included standardizing text fields, converting sales data to numeric values, formatting release dates, and merging the release date columns from both sources. Additionally, I retained only North American and total sales data while discarding index columns. The cleaned datasets were saved as VGSales_union.csv and VGSales_intersect.csv, containing 68,288 and 12,288 observations, respectively.

        <h2>3. Analysis</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Statistical Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            To explore whether higher review scores correlate with increased game sales, I calculated correlation coefficients between sales figures and review scores. Notably, there was a strong correlation of 0.954 between total and North American sales, with North America accounting for 48.7% of total game sales. However, the relationship between review scores and sales was weak. The correlation coefficient between total sales and meta score was 0.248, while it was only 0.102 for total sales and user score. Interestingly, user scores and meta scores had a moderate correlation of 0.524. To examine potential discrepancies in rating scales, I created a boxplot comparing user and meta scores (Figure 1) and a histogram (Figure 2), which highlighted differences in rating distributions. Meta scores tended to cluster higher, whereas user scores showed a greater spread of lower ratings. This likely explains why meta scores correlated slightly better with sales.

          <figcaption>Figure 1: Histogram of scores</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The meta score is a better predictor of sales than the user score.
          While the correlation isn’t very strong, it does exist. There is some
          basis for the reason behind this correlation. Many companies send out
          review copies to critics in hopes that the reviews will boost sales5.
          Critics usually publish their review scores in the days before a game
          is released. This increases excitement around the game before the
          general release date benefitting both the video game company and the
          critic. However, the correlation appears to show that there probably
          isn’t as much benefit in this manufacturer critic relationship as the
          manufacturer would like. I initially thought the weak correlation
          might be due to the large number of games with little sales. I
          recalculated the correlation coefficient between meta score and total
          sales which produced even less of a correlation at .065. While high
          review scores may help a company’s reputation, they do not correlate
          well with more sales.
        </p>
        <h3>3.2 Insights</h3>
        <p>
          To find out which video game publishers have the highest sales, I
          created a summary data frame, publisher_df, which was grouped by the
          publisher. In this data frame, I included the ratings’ average, the
          sales’ sum, and the number of games each publisher has released. To
          find the publishers with the highest sales, I took a slice_max of the
          data frame based on the total sales. The result appears in Table 2.
          The information is also saved in the publisher_sales.csv file in the
          project folder. Table 2 Slice Max Summary publisher total_sales

          one publisher released at least 800 games. I calculated the
          correlation between the total sales and the number of games a
          publisher had released. The coefficient of correlation between these
          two variables was .715, which demonstrates a strong correlation
          between the number of games released and the total sales of a
          publisher. Because of this strong correlation, I thought creating a
          scatterplot between the two variables would be useful to analyze the
          data further. The scatterplot can be seen in Figure 3 below.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          This correlation does not apply to the number of games released and
          the publisher’s average meta score. The correlation coefficient
          between these two variables is -.013, which is evidence of no
          relationship between the number of games released and the average meta
          score. With the strong correlation between the number of games and
          total sales, we can predict that a company’s average meta score
          doesn’t significantly impact its total sales. When we compare the
          average meta score of 71.145 to the values in Table 2 (above), we
          prove that meta scores and sales aren’t strongly correlated, as 30% of
          the observations in Table 2 are below the average. This can also be
          seen in Figure 4, a scatterplot of the number of games released and
          the meta score. Figure 4 Scatterplot of the number of games by a

          I compared the top ten game publishers by North American sales and by
          total sales for the past ten years. I wanted to know if there is there
          a difference between those with high sales in North America and those
          with high total sales. Could another region be driving publisher sales
          success? I found the same game publishers in both lists, but in a
          slightly different order. Total sales ranged from about 260 million
          games to about 1.9 billion games. Games sold in North America was
          responsible for about 40 – 60% of the total sales numbers. More
          details can be found in the top_10_NA and top_10_total data frames.
          The top ten publishers appear in Table 3. Table 3 Top publishers by

          Rockstar Games 3.3 Release Date To determine how sales, number of
          games released, and review scores have changed, I created a data frame
          called by_month, which grouped the games by month and calculated the
          average review scores, the sum of sales, and the number of games. To
          make the dates easier to use in a scatterplot, I decided to change the
          data type to date format. I did this by setting the column as a date
          with the day value being the first day of the month the game was
          released. To start my analysis, I wanted to see if there is an
          increase in the number of games being developed over time. The
          correlation coefficient between the release date and the number of
          games released is .533, which is evidence of some correlation, but it
          is not especially strong. Next, I created a plot of the number of
          games released in relation to the date. I also compared the total
          sales of games over time, using the patchwork package6, to see if
          there was a clear pattern between the number of games released and
          total sales. This scatterplot can be seen in Figure 5.

          The point at the end should be ignored, as it includes two games yet
          to be released. The outlier of games released in 2020 should also be
          ignored, as many games were misclassified to this date by the
          websites. Figure 5 reveals a large peak in the number of games
          released around 2010 before decreasing again. The sales of games did
          not see this same spike. The purchase of games released after 2010
          remained somewhat consistent, unlike the number of games released in
          that same period. The increase in games around the late 2000s is
          likely due to the release of new video game consoles that reached many
          mainstream markets. Many video game consoles could also play Blu-ray
          discs and had multimedia features7, which increased their popularity.
          To further analyze sales, I looked at how the passage of time has
          affected sales globally versus in North America. The correlation
          coefficient between total sales and the release date is .273, much
          lower than for the number of games released and the release date. This
          also holds for the correlation between North American sales and the
          release date, which has a correlation coefficient of .229. Figure 6
          shows a graph comparing the sales to the release date.

        <p>
          The trend of frequent outliers appears to be much greater for total
          sales than it is for North American sales. Taking a slice_max of both
          North American and total sales shows this pattern is likely due to
          increased sales during the holiday season. The top ten sales months
          for both these variables are in October and November. Many game
          publishers have caught on to the increase in sales during these
          months. Many of the months with the most games released are also in
          this timeframe. While there was an increase in sales throughout the
          2000s, the same cannot be said about review scores.

        <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I analyzed three aspects of video game sales: the
          publisher, the release date, and how a game’s sales and review scores
          influence each other. In summary, from the analysis questions
          presented in my proposal, I found the following results. 1. Is there a
          strong correlation between a game’s review score and its sales? Is the
          meta score or the user score a better predictor of a game’s sales?
          There is limited correlation between review scores and sales. But
          while the correlation isn’t very strong, it does appear meta score is
          a better predictor of sales than the user score. 2. Have the total
          sales of games seen an increase over the years? There is some
          correlation between release date and number of games released, but it
          is not especially strong. There was a peak in the number of games
          released around 2010 but since there has been a decline. 3. Which
          publishers have had the highest sales over the past ten years? Is
          there a difference between those with high sales in North America and
          those with high total sales? The top ten publishers are listed above
          in Table 3. The same ten publishers are present in both total sales
          and North American sales, just in a different order. Nintendo is
          solidly in first place with 1.9 billion games sold followed by
          Activision at number two with 727 million units sold. North American
          sales accounts for 40 – 60% of total sales making this region a
          significant contributor to sales success for game publishers. 4. Is
          the console on which a game is released strongly correlated to its
          ratings? Specifically, are there certain video game consoles that have
          the highest average ratings of games? The variables needed to answer
          this question were not present in the collected data. As noted below,
          this question would be an opportunity for further work on this
          project. This project has several limitations, including the lack of
          review scores for games released before the mid-90s, the improper
          release dates of some games, and the lack of information about the
          video game consoles. Future work on this project could include finding
          more sources to create a more complete dataset, analyzing the purchase
          of different video game consoles to see if the spikes in new video
          game releases coincide with more people buying video game consoles,
          and analyzing whether more time in between game releases for a
          publisher really means a better game (higher sales and review scores).
