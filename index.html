        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            According to PEW Research, 96% of adults aged 18-29 occasionally check reviews before purchasing a product. But does this necessarily mean that higher ratings lead to greater sales? Specifically, when it comes to video games, do high ratings equate to increased sales volume? While it's possible that well-rated games sell more copies, some lesser-known titles with passionate fan bases might receive better ratings than widely popular games with massive sales figures. Additionally, I’m interested in examining whether video game production has surged in recent years and, if so, whether this increase has impacted the quality of games, as measured by their reviews. Could an oversaturated market lead to declining review scores over time?
            
            
        </p>
        <p>
            For this project, I intend to analyze user and critic review scores from Metacritic and correlate them with sales data from VGChartz. By merging these datasets, I aim to determine whether a relationship exists between review scores and overall game sales.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
        <p>
            I gathered review data from Metacritic, which included both user (user score) and critic (meta score) ratings for various games. The data was compiled from 186 different web pages using a web scraping script. The dataset comprises details such as game titles, summaries, platforms, user scores, meta scores, and release dates for 18,526 games. Some games appeared multiple times due to releases on different platforms, an important factor to consider when merging datasets. This information is stored in Metacritic.csv, while the web scraping script is saved in metacritic.R. Minimal cleaning was required, though I did create a dictionary to align platform names from Metacritic with those from VGChartz. This cleaning process is documented in combining_vgs.R.
        </p>
        <h3>2.2 Additional Data</h3>
        <p>
            VGChartz offers sales figures for different game/platform combinations. The dataset spans 1,249 web pages, so I split the extracted data into six separate CSV files (VGChartz_0–5.csv). These files are housed in the project folder, along with the web scraping script, vgchartz.R. The dataset covers game titles, platforms, release dates, publishers, and regional sales figures from PAL, Japan, and North America, in addition to total global sales. Some titles appeared multiple times due to releases on different platforms, and some game series were listed alongside individual entries. To clean the dataset, I combined all six CSV files into a single dataset, removed unnecessary columns, standardized text formatting, and filtered out game series. Missing values were labeled as NA. The data cleaning for this dataset was also performed in combining_vgs.R.
        </p>
        <h3>2.3 Combining Reviews and Sales</h3>
        <p>
            Since both datasets contained duplicate game titles based on platform differences, I merged them by matching both game titles and platforms. Given the significant discrepancy in the number of observations in each dataset, I created two versions of the merged dataset: an intersection containing only games present in both datasets and a union including all available data. The merging process is detailed in combining_vgs.R, and further cleaning was conducted in cleaning_vgs.R. This included standardizing text fields, converting sales data to numeric values, formatting release dates, and merging the release date columns from both sources. Additionally, I retained only North American and total sales data while discarding index columns. The cleaned datasets were saved as VGSales_union.csv and VGSales_intersect.csv, containing 68,288 and 12,288 observations, respectively.

        <h2>3. Analysis</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Statistical Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            To explore whether higher review scores correlate with increased game sales, I calculated correlation coefficients between sales figures and review scores. Notably, there was a strong correlation of 0.954 between total and North American sales, with North America accounting for 48.7% of total game sales. However, the relationship between review scores and sales was weak. The correlation coefficient between total sales and meta score was 0.248, while it was only 0.102 for total sales and user score. Interestingly, user scores and meta scores had a moderate correlation of 0.524. To examine potential discrepancies in rating scales, I created a boxplot comparing user and meta scores (Figure 1) and a histogram (Figure 2), which highlighted differences in rating distributions. Meta scores tended to cluster higher, whereas user scores showed a greater spread of lower ratings. This likely explains why meta scores correlated slightly better with sales.

        </figure>
        <p>
            The meta score appears to be a stronger predictor of sales compared to the user score. While the correlation is not particularly strong, there is still some connection. This relationship likely stems from the practice of game companies distributing review copies to critics in hopes of generating positive press that could drive sales. Critics typically release their reviews in the days leading up to a game's official launch, which can help build anticipation. However, the data suggests that this dynamic may not be as beneficial to publishers as they might expect. Initially, I suspected that the weak correlation was due to the large number of low-selling games in the dataset. When I recalculated the correlation between meta scores and total sales, the result was an even lower value of 0.065, reinforcing the idea that while high review scores may enhance a company’s reputation, they do not necessarily lead to increased sales.
        </p>
        <h3>3.2 Insights</h3>
        <p>
            To determine which video game publishers achieve the highest sales, I compiled a summary data frame, publisher_df, grouped by publisher. This dataset included the average review ratings, total sales, and the number of games released per publisher. To identify the top-selling publishers, I selected the ones with the highest total sales, as shown in Table 2. This data is also stored in the publisher_sales.csv file within the project directory.

            Table 2 provides a breakdown of the top publishers, including Nintendo, which leads with over 1.9 billion units sold, followed by Activision with 727 million. All but one publisher in the top ten have released at least 800 games. Examining the correlation between total sales and the number of games published, I found a strong correlation coefficient of 0.715. This suggests that publishers producing a larger number of games tend to achieve higher overall sales. Given this strong correlation, I created a scatterplot to visualize the relationship, as illustrated in Figure 3.
            
            Interestingly, this correlation does not extend to the number of games released and the average meta score. The correlation coefficient between these variables is -0.013, indicating no significant relationship. This suggests that while publishers who release more games tend to generate higher sales, their average game quality, as measured by meta scores, does not necessarily improve. Comparing the average meta score of 71.145 with the values in Table 2, we see that 30% of the publishers in the table fall below this average, further supporting the weak link between review scores and sales. Figure 4 presents a scatterplot illustrating this lack of correlation.
            
            To analyze regional differences in sales success, I compared the top ten publishers by North American sales and total sales over the last decade. The same publishers appeared in both lists but in slightly different rankings. The total number of units sold ranged from approximately 260 million to 1.9 billion, with North American sales contributing 40-60% of total sales. This indicates that the North American market plays a crucial role in overall publisher success. The full details are available in the top_10_NA and top_10_total data frames, with the top ten publishers shown in Table 3.

            There is no significant correlation between the number of games released by a publisher and their average meta score. The correlation coefficient for these variables is -0.013, indicating no meaningful relationship. Despite the strong correlation between the number of games released and total sales, this does not translate to higher meta scores. A publisher’s average meta score does not appear to have a notable impact on overall sales. Comparing the industry-wide average meta score of 71.145 to the values in Table 2, we observe that 30% of the listed publishers fall below this benchmark, reinforcing the weak connection between review scores and sales. Figure 4, which presents a scatterplot of the number of games released and their corresponding meta scores, further illustrates this lack of correlation.

            I analyzed the top ten game publishers based on North American sales and total global sales over the past decade to determine if regional differences influenced their rankings. My goal was to see if publishers with strong North American sales also led in total sales or if another region played a significant role in driving publisher success. The results revealed that the same publishers appeared in both lists, though their rankings varied slightly. Total game sales ranged from approximately 260 million to 1.9 billion units, with North America accounting for about 40–60% of total sales. More details on these rankings are available in the top_10_NA and top_10_total data frames. The top ten publishers, based on both North American and total sales, are summarized in Table 3.
            To examine how game sales, the number of releases, and review scores have changed over time, I created a dataset called by_month. This dataset grouped games by their release month and calculated average review scores, total sales, and the number of games released. To facilitate visual analysis, I formatted the release date column so that each game was assigned the first day of the month in which it was released.

            One of my key objectives was to determine whether the number of games released has increased over time. The correlation coefficient between the release date and the number of games released is 0.533, indicating a moderate relationship, though not a particularly strong one. To visualize this trend, I plotted the number of games released over time and compared it with total game sales. Using the patchwork package, I created a scatterplot (Figure 5) to assess any clear patterns between game releases and total sales.

            The final data point should be disregarded, as it includes two games that have yet to be released. Additionally, an anomaly in 2020, where many games were misclassified to that year, should also be ignored. Figure 5 illustrates a significant spike in game releases around 2010, followed by a decline. However, game sales did not experience the same sharp increase. Instead, the sales of games released post-2010 remained relatively stable, despite fluctuations in the number of releases.

            The surge in game releases during the late 2000s likely corresponds with the launch of new video game consoles, which expanded their presence in mainstream markets. Many of these consoles introduced multimedia capabilities, such as Blu-ray playback, which contributed to their widespread appeal.
            
            To further investigate sales trends over time, I examined the relationship between release date and total sales, comparing global sales with those in North America. The correlation coefficient between total sales and release date was 0.273, significantly lower than the correlation between the number of releases and release date. A similar pattern was observed for North American sales, which had a correlation coefficient of 0.229 with release date. Figure 6 presents a visual representation of the relationship between sales and release dates.

        </figure>
        <p>
            Outliers in total sales appear far more frequently than in North American sales. Analyzing the highest sales months for both categories reveals that this pattern is likely driven by increased purchases during the holiday season. The top ten months for sales consistently fall in October and November, indicating that game publishers have adapted to this trend by strategically timing their releases to capitalize on peak consumer spending. Additionally, many of the months with the highest number of game releases align with this sales surge.

            While game sales saw steady growth throughout the 2000s, review scores did not follow the same upward trend.

        <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I explored three key aspects of video game sales: the influence of publishers, the impact of release dates, and the relationship between sales and review scores. Based on the research questions outlined in my proposal, I arrived at the following conclusions:

            Is there a strong correlation between a games review score and its sales? Which is a better predictor, the meta score or the user score?
            
            The correlation between review scores and sales is weak. However, among the two review metrics, the meta score serves as a slightly better predictor of sales than the user score.
            
            Have total game sales increased over the years?
            
            There is some correlation between release date and the number of games released, though it is not particularly strong. The data reveals a peak in game releases around 2010, followed by a decline.
            
            Which publishers have had the highest sales over the past decade? Is there a distinction between those excelling in North American sales versus total global sales?
            
            The top ten publishers, as shown in Table 3, remain consistent across both total and North American sales, albeit in a slightly different order. Nintendo dominates with 1.9 billion units sold, followed by Activision with 727 million. North American sales contribute significantly to overall figures, accounting for 40–60% of total sales.
            
            Is a games rating strongly correlated with the console it is released on? Are certain consoles associated with higher average ratings?
            
            The dataset did not contain the necessary variables to answer this question. This presents an opportunity for further research.
            
            This study has several limitations, including the absence of review scores for games released before the mid-1990s, inaccuracies in some reported release dates, and missing information about specific gaming consoles. Future research could expand the dataset, analyze how console adoption trends align with game release spikes, and examine whether longer development times contribute to better sales and higher review scores.
